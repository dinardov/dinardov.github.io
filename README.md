# How I Built My Portfolio Website

I was really inspired by [Tom Nick's](https://tomnick.org/) website (after seeing his Pokemon battle cry website) to make something clean and simple, but also still looking relatively modern (and also low-effort, but not CMS style).

After about a month of me feeling like I didn't have the right *front-end skills* to make something *fancy*, and a bunch of YouTube videos later, I remembered a very important truth:

> It is better to make something than to not make anything at all.

Ah, yes. A generic adage about how if I continue to do nothing, there is nothing to improve upon. So let's just accept the fact that my website isn't going to be the *fanciest*, but rather a constant work in progress. Once I get the basic content done, then I can work towards improving its fanciness.

## 1. The Basics

The basic layout was all done with Bootstrap and CSS, along with some extra dependencies like Google Fonts.

As of right now, I still don't know how to do basic page navigation that looks nice (not a hard refresh). I also still am unsure how to do navigation without JS.

## 2. The Basics+

1. Using the [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) extension to edit Bootstrap Sass. It's important to import the "necessary" files, make overrides, and then import the main bootstrap folder. See the [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/theming/#sass). This is how you can change things like the primary and secondary colors. 

## 3. The Not-So-Basics
